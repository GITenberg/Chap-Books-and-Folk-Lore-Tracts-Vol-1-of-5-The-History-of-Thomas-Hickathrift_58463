<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> seems to be some considerable reason for believing
that the hero of this story was a reality. The story tells us
that he lived in the marsh of the Isle of Ely, and that he
became &#8220;a brewer&#8217;s man&#8221; at Lyn, and traded to Wisbeach.
This little piece of geographical evidence enables us to fix the
story as belonging to the great Fen District, which occupied the
north of Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.</p>

<p>The antiquary Thomas Hearne has gone so far as to identify
the hero of tradition with a doughty knight of the Crusaders.
Writing in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol. xxi. p. 102), Sir Francis
Palgrave says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thomas Hickathrift, afterwards Sir Thomas Hickathrift,
Knight, is praised by Mr. Thomas Hearne as a &#8216;famous
champion.&#8217; The honest antiquary has identified this well-known
knight with the far less celebrated Sir Frederick de
Tylney, Baron of Tylney in Norfolk, the ancestor of the
Tylney family, who was killed at Acon, in Syria, in the reign
of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion. Hycophric, or Hycothrift, as the
mister-wight observes, being probably a corruption of Frederick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
This happy exertion of etymological acumen is not wholly due
to Hearne, who only adopted a hint given by Mr. Philip le
Neve, whilome of the College of Arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>There does not seem to be the slightest evidence for Hearne&#8217;s
identification any more than there is for his philological conclusions,
and we may pass over this for other and more reliable
information.</p>

<p>We must first of all turn to the story itself, as it has come
down to us in its chapbook form. It is divided into two parts.
The first part of the story is the earliest; the second part
being evidently a printer&#8217;s or a chapman&#8217;s addition. Our
reprint of the former is taken from the copy in the Pepysian
Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and which was
printed probably about 1660-1690; the latter is taken from the
British Museum copy, the date of which, according to the
Museum authorities, is 1780.</p>

<p>In trying to ascertain something as to the date of the story
apart from that of its printed version, it will therefore be
necessary to put out of consideration the second portion. This
has been written by some one well acquainted with the original
first part, and with the spirit of the story; but in spite of this
there is undoubted evidence of its literary origin at a date later
than the first part. But turning to the first part there are two
expressions in this early Pepysian version which have not
been repeated in the later editions&mdash;those of the eighteenth
century; and these two expressions appear to me to indicate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
date <i>after which</i> the story could not have been originated. On
page 1 we read that Tom Hickathrift dwelt &#8220;in the <i>marsh</i> of
the Isle of Ely.&#8221; In the earliest British Museum copy this
appears as &#8220;in the <i>parish</i> of the Isle of Ely.&#8221; Again, on page 11
Tom is described as laying out the giant&#8217;s estate, &#8220;some of which
he gave to the poor for their common, and the rest he made
pastures of and divided the most part into <i>good ground</i>, to maintain
him and his old mother Jane Hickathrift.&#8221; In the earliest
British Museum copy the expression &#8220;good ground&#8221; is displaced
by &#8220;tillage.&#8221; Now it is clear from these curious transposition
of words in the earliest and latest editions that something
had been going on to change the nature of the country.
The eighteenth-century people did not know the &#8220;marsh&#8221; of
Ely, so they read &#8220;parish&#8221;: they did not know the meaning of
&#8220;good ground&#8221; so they read &#8220;tillage.&#8221; And hence it is clear
that at the printing of this earliest version the fen lands of
Cambridge and Norfolk had not yet been drained; there was
still &#8220;marsh land&#8221; which was being made into &#8220;good land.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I think there is evidence in this printed chap-book
version of the story which tells us that it was taken from a
traditional version. Let any one take the trouble to read aloud
the first part, and he will at once perceive that there is a ring
and a cadence given to the voice by the wording of the story,
and particularly by the curious punctuation, which at once
reminds us of a narrative from word of mouth. And besides
this there is some little evidence of phonetic spelling, just such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
as might have been expected from the first printer taking the
story from the lips of one of the Fen-country peasantry.</p>

<p>Now this internal evidence of the once <i>viva-voce</i> existence
of the printed legend of Tom Hickathrift has a direct bearing
upon the question as to the date of the earliest printed version.
The colloquialisms are so few, and the rhythm, though marked
and definite, is occasionally so halting and approaches so nearly
a literary form, that we are forced to observe that the earliest
printed edition now known is certainly not the earliest version
printed. There are too few phoneticisms and dialect words to
make it probable that the print in the Pepysian collection is the
one directly derived from popular tradition. As the various
printers in the eighteenth century altered words and sentences
here and there, as different editions were issued, so did the
seventeenth-century printers; and therefore it is necessary to
push the date of the printed version farther back than we can
hope to ascertain by direct evidence. There is no reason why
there should not have been a sixteenth-century printed version,
and to this period I am inclined to allocate the earliest appearance
of the story in print.</p>

<p>And then prior to the printed version was the popular version
with its almost endless life, perhaps reaching back to that vague
period indicated in the opening words of the story, &#8220;in the
reign before William the Conqueror.&#8221; Already internal
evidence has, it is suggested, pointed to a popular unwritten
tradition of Tom Hickathrift&#8217;s life and exploits. But we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
ask now, Is there, or was there, any tradition among the peasantry
of Lyn and its neighbourhood about Thomas Hickathrift?
And, if so, how far does this popular tradition reach
back, and how far does it tally with the chap-book version?
Again, is this popular tradition independent of the chap-book
story, or has it been generated from the printed book? To
answer these questions properly we must closely examine all
the evidence available as to the existence and form of this
popular tradition.</p>

<p>Turning first of all to the historian of Norfolk, Blomefield,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
writing in 1808, gives us the following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The town of Tilney gives name to a famous common
called Tilney Smeeth, whereon 30,000 or more large Marshland
sheep and the great cattle of seven towns to which it
belongs are constantly said to feed. Of this plain of Smeeth
there is a tradition, <i>which the common people retain</i>, that in
old time the inhabitants of these towns [Tilney, Terrington,
Clenchwarton, Islington, Walpole, West Walton, Walsoken,
and Emneth] had a contest with the lords of the manors about
the bounds and limits of it, when one <i>Hickifric</i>, a person of
great stature and courage, assisting the said inhabitants in their
rights of common, took an axle-tree from a cart-wheel, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of a sword, and the wheel for a shield or buckler, and thus armed
soon repelled the invaders. And for proof of this notable exploit
they to this day show, says Sir William Dugdale [Dugd. <i>Hist. of
Imbanking</i>, &amp;c. p. 244; Weever&#8217;s <i>Fun. Mon.</i> p. 866], a large
grave-stone near the east end of the chancel in Tilney churchyard,
whereon the form of a cross is so cut or carved as that
the upper part thereof (wherewith the carver hath adorned it)
being circular, they will therefore needs have it to be the gravestone
of <i>Hickifric</i>, and to be as a memorial of his gallantry.
The stone coffin, which stands now out of the ground in
Tilney churchyard, on the north side of the church, will not
receive a person above six feet in length, and this is shown as
belonging formerly to the giant <i>Hickifric</i>. The cross said to
be a representation of the cart-wheel is a cross pattée, on the
summit of a staff, which staff is styled an axle-tree. Such crosses
pattée on the head of a staff were emblems or tokens that some
Knight Templar was therein interred, and many such are to be
seen at this day in old churches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the reference to Sir William Dugdale is misleading,
because, as will be seen by the following quotation, the position
of the hero is altered in Dugdale&#8217;s version of the legend from
that of a popular leader to the tyrant lord himself:&mdash;&#8220;Of this
plain I may not omit a tradition which the common people
thereabouts have, viz., that in old time the inhabitants of the
neighbouring villages had a fierce contest with one Hickifric
(the then owner of it) touching the bounds thereof, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
grew so hot that at length it came to blows; and that Hickifric,
being a person of extraordinary stature and courage, took
an axletree from a cart instead of a sword, and the wheel for
his buckler, and, being so armed, most stoutly repelled those bold
invaders: for further testimony of which notable exploit they
to this day show a large gravestone near the east end of the
chancel in Tilney churchyard, whereupon the form of a cross
is so cut as that the upper part thereof by reason of the flourishes
(wherewith the carver hath adorned it) sheweth to
be somewhat circular, which they will, therefore, needs have
to be the wheel and the shaft the axletree.&#8221; This version,
taken from Dugdale&#8217;s <i>History of Imbanking</i>, 1772, p. 244,
though differing in form, at all events serves to carry us back
to 1662, the date when Sir William Dugdale&#8217;s <i>History</i> was first
published.</p>

<p>But the local tradition can be carried further back than
1662, because the learned Sir Henry Spelman, in his <i>Icenia
sive Norfolciae Descriptio Topographica</i>, p. 138, and written
about 1640, says, when speaking of Tilney, in Marshland
Hundred: &#8220;Hic se expandit insignis area quæ à planicie nuncupatur
Tylney-smelth, pinguis adeo et luxurians ut Paduana
pascua videatur superasse.... Tuentur eam indigenæ velut
Aras et Focos, fabellamque recitant longa petitam vetustate
de Hikifrico (nescio quo) Haii illius instar in Scotorum
Chronicis, qui Civium suorum dedignatus fuga, Aratrum
quod agebat, solvit; arreptoque Temone furibundus insiliit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
in hostes victoriamque ademit exultantibus. Sic cum de agri
istius finibus acriter olim dimicatum esset inter fundi Dominun
et Villarum Incolas, nec valerent hi ad versus eum consistere;
redeuntibus occurrit Hikifricus, axemque excutiens a curru
quem agebat, eo vice Gladii usus; Rotâ, Clypei; invasores
repulit ad ipsos quibus nunc funguntur terminos. Ostendunt
in cæmeterio Tilniensi, Sepulcrum sui pugilis, Axem cum
Rota insculptum exhibens.&#8221;</p>

<p>A still earlier version is to be found recorded by Weever
in 1631. The full quotation is as follows: &#8220;Tylney Smeeth,
so called of a smooth plaine or common thereunto adioyning....
In the Churchyard is a ridg&#8217;d Altar, Tombe, or sepulchre
of a wondrous antique fashion, vpon which an axell-tree and
a cart wheele are insculped. Vnder this Funerall Monument
the Towne dwellers say that one Hikifricke lies interred; of
whom (<i>as it hath gone by tradition from father to the sonne</i>)
they thus likewise report: How that vpon a time (no man
knowes how long since) there happened a great quarrell betwixt
the Lord of this land or ground and the inhabitants of the
foresaid seuen villages, about the meere-marks, limits, or bondaries
of this fruitfull feeding place; the matter came to a
battell or skirmish, in which the said Inhabitants being not
able to resist the landlord and his forces began to giue backe;
Hikifricke, driuing his cart along and perceiuing that his
neighbours were fainthearted, and ready to take flight, he
shooke the Axell tree from the cart which he vsed instead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
sword, and tooke one of the cart-wheeles which he held as a
buckler; with these weapons he set vpon the Common aduersaries
or aduersaries of the Common, encouraged his neighbours
to go forward, and fight valiantly in defence of their
liberties; who being animated by his manly prowesse, they
tooke heart to grasse, as the prouerbe is, insomuch that they
chased the Landlord and his companie to the vtmost verge of
the said Common; which from that time they haue quietly
enioyed to this very day. The Axell-tree and cart-wheele are
cut and figured in diuers places of the Church and Church
windowes, which makes the story, you must needs say, more
probable. This relation doth in many parts parallell with
that of one Hay, a strong braue spirited Scottish Plowman,
who vpon a set battell of Scots against the Danes, being
working at the same time in the next field, and seeing some
of his countreymen to flie from that hote encounter, caught vp
an oxe yoke (Boëthius saith, a Plough-beame), with which
(after some exhortation that they should not bee faint-hearted)
he beate the said straglers backe againe to the maine
Army, where he with his two sonnes (who tooke likewise such
weapons as came next to their hands) renewed the charge so
furiously that they quite discomfited the enemy, obtaining the
glory of the day and victory for their drad Lord and Soueraigne
Kenneth the third, King of Scotland; and this happened
in the yeare 942, the second of the King&#8217;s raigne. This
you may reade at large in the <i>History of Scotland</i>, thus abridged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
by Camden as followeth.&#8221;&mdash;Weever&#8217;s <i>Funerall Monuments</i>,
1631, pp. 866-867.</p>

<p>And Sir Francis Palgrave, quoting the legend from Spelman,
observes,&mdash;&#8220;From the most remote antiquity the fables and
achievements of Hickifric have been obstinately credited by the
inhabitants of the township of Tylney. Hickifric is venerated
by them as the assertor of the rights and liberties of their ancestors.
The &#8216;monstrous giant&#8217; who guarded the marsh was
in truth no other than the tyrannical lord of the manor who
attempted to keep his copyholders out of the common field,
Tylney Smeeth; but who was driven away with his retainers
by the prowess of Tom armed only with his axletree and
cart-wheel.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> This does not appear to me to put the case too
strongly. A tradition told so readily and believed so generally
in the middle of the seventeenth century must have had a
strong vitality in it only to be obtained by age.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the other side, namely, the existence of
a traditional version in modern days, because it is important
to note that the printing of a chapbook version need not have
disturbed the full current of traditional thought. In a note Sir
Francis Palgrave seems to imply that the story was still extant
without the aid of printed literature. He writes:</p>

<p>&#8220;A Norfolk antiquary has had the goodness to procure for
us an authentic report of the present state of Tom&#8217;s sepulchre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
It is a stone soros, of the usual shape and dimensions; the
sculptured lid or cover no longer exists. It must have been
entire about fifty years ago, for when we were good <i>Gaffer
Crane would rehearse Tom&#8217;s achievements</i>, and tell us that he
had cut out the moss which filled up the inscription with his
penknife, but he could not read the letters.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>And Clare, in his <i>Village Minstrel</i>, tells us that:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here Lubin listen&#8217;d with awestruck surprise,</div>
<div class="verse">When Hickathrift&#8217;s great strength has met his ear;</div>
<div class="verse">How he kill&#8217;d giants as they were but flies,</div>
<div class="verse">And lifted trees as one would a spear,</div>
<div class="verse">Though not much bigger than his fellows were;</div>
<div class="verse">He knew no troubles waggoners have known,</div>
<div class="verse">Of getting stall&#8217;d and such disasters drear;</div>
<div class="verse">Up he&#8217;d chuck sacks as we would hurl a stone,</div>
<div class="verse">And draw whole loads of grain unaided and alone.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And this view as to the existence still of a traditional form of
the story is almost borne out by what the country people only
recently had to say relative to a monument in that part of the
country over which Sir William Dugdale travelled, and of
which he has left us such a valuable memorial in his <i>History of
Imbanking</i>. A writer in the Journal of the Archaeological Association
(vol. xxv. p. 11) says:&mdash;&#8220;A mound close to the Smeeth
Road Station, between Lynn and Wisbech, is called the Giant&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Grave, and the inhabitants relate that there lie the remains of
the great giant slain by Hickathrift with the cart wheel and
axletree. A cross was erected upon it, and is to be seen in the
neighbouring churchyard of Torrington St. John&#8217;s, bearing the
singular name of Hickathrift&#8217;s Candlestick.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the following may be considered the
chief evidence which we have obtained about the existence of
the story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p>That a chapbook or literary form of the story has existed
from the sixteenth century;</p>

<p>That a traditional story existed quite independently of the
literary story in the seventeenth century;</p>

<p>That a traditional story exists at the present time, or until
very recently;</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>And knowing what folk-lore has to say about the long life of
traditions, about their constant repetition age after age, it is not,
I venture to think, too much to conclude that a story which
can be shown by evidence to have lived on from mouth to
mouth for two centuries is capable of going back to an almost
endless antiquity for its true original.</p>

<p>Let us now consider what may be the origin of this story.
There is one theory as to this which has gained the authority
of Sir Francis Palgrave. The pranks which Tom performed
&#8220;must be noticed,&#8221; says Sir Francis, &#8220;as being correctly Scandinavian.&#8221;
He then goes on to say, &#8220;Similar were the achievements
of the great Northern champion Grettir, when he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
geese upon the common, as told in his Saga. Tom&#8217;s youth
retraces the tales of the prowess of the youthful Siegfried
detailed in the Niblunga Saga and in the book of Heroes. It
appears from Hearne that the supposed axle-tree, with the
superincumbent wheel, was represented on &#8216;Hycothrift&#8217;s&#8217; grave-stone
in Tylney churchyard in the shape of a cross. This is
the form in which all the Runic monuments represent the
celebrated hammer or thunderbolt of the son of Odin, which
shattered the skulls and scattered the brains of so many luckless
giants. How far this surmise may be supported by Tom&#8217;s skill
and strength in throwing the hammer we will not pretend to
decide.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>Now this takes the story entirely out of the simple category
of local English tradition, and places it at once among those
grand mythic tales which belong to the study of comparative
mythology and which take us back to the earliest of man&#8217;s
thought and belief. In order to test this theory let us have
before us the passages in Tom Hickathrift&#8217;s history which
might be said to bear it out, and then let us compare them with
the stories of Grettir.</p>

<p>The analysis of the story based upon the plan laid down by
the Folk-Lore Society is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Tom&#8217;s parents are nobodies, &#8220;a poor man and day
labourer&#8221; being his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>(2.) Tom was obstinate as a boy.</p>

<p>(3.) Loses his father, and at first does not help his mother,
but sits in the chimney corner.</p>

<p>(4.) Is of great height and size.</p>

<p>(5.) Strength is unknown until he shows it.</p>

<p>(6.) Commits many pranks, among which is the throwing
&#8220;a hammer five or six furlongs off into a river.&#8221;</p>

<p>(7.) Kills a giant with a club, Tom using axletree and
wheel for his shield and buckler.</p>

<p>(8.) Takes possession of the giant&#8217;s territory and lives
there.</p>

<p>(9.) Commits more pranks, &#8220;kicks a football right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>(10.) Escapes from four thieves and despoils them.</p>

<p>(11.) Is defeated by a tinker.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>It will not be necessary to analyse the whole of the stories to
which we are referred for the mythic parallels of Tom Hickathrift;
but I will take out the items corresponding to those
tabulated above. In the story of &#8220;Grettir the Strong&#8221; we
have the following incidents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Grettir&#8217;s father &#8220;had his homestead and farm land.&#8221;</p>

<p>(2.) Grettir was obstinate as a boy (does nothing on board
ship.)</p>

<p>(3.) Plays pranks upon his father, and returns from
attending the horses to the fire-side (Iceland).</p>

<p>(4.) Is short, though strong, and big of body.</p>

<p>(5.) He had not skill to turn his great strength to account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>(6.) He wrestles with other lads, and commits many
pranks, flings a rock from its place.</p>

<p>(7.) Wrestles with Karr, the barrow dweller; and</p>

<p>(8.) Takes possession of Karr&#8217;s weapons and wealth.</p>

<p>(9.) Fights with and conquers robbers.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Now it cannot be denied that there is a great similarity in
the thread of these two stories. Norfolk, the colony of the
Northmen of old, may well have retained its ancient tradition
until the moving incidents of English economic history brought
about the weaving of it into the actual life that was pressing
round men&#8217;s thoughts. It would thus leave out the great mass
of detail in the old northern tradition, and retain just sufficient
to fit in with the new requirements; and in this way it appears
to me we have the present form of the story of Tom Hickathrift,
its ancient Scandinavian outline, its more modern English
application. Now it is curious to note that the cart-wheel
plays a not unimportant part in English folk-lore as a representative
of old runic faith. Sir Henry Ellis, in his edition of
Brand&#8217;s <i>Popular Antiquities</i> (vol. i. p. 298), has collected together
some instances of this; and whatever causes may have led
to this survival there is nothing to prevent us from looking
upon the wheel and axle in the story of Tom Hickathrift as a
part and parcel of the same survival.</p>

<p>There now remains to notice one or two points of interest
outside the narrative of the story itself. Of curious expressions
we have&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<blockquote>

<p>fitted (p. 3), to pay any one out, to revenge one&#8217;s self;</p>

<p>buttle of straw (p. 3);</p>

<p>shift (p. 3), to support, to make shift. See Davies&#8217;s <i>Supplementary
Glossary</i>, <i>sub voce</i> &#8220;make-shift,&#8221; &#8220;shiftful&#8221;;</p>

<p>bone-fires (p. 11). See Ellis&#8217;s <i>Brand&#8217;s Popular Antiquities</i>,
vol. i. p. 300, note;</p>

<p>cocksure (p. 14), quite sure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of proverbs there are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>to win the horse or lose the saddle (p. 8);</p>

<p>to make hay while the sun did shine (p. 10).</p></blockquote>

<p>Of games there are mentioned&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>cudgells (p. 4);</p>

<p>wrestling (p. 4);</p>

<p>throwing the hammer (p. 4);</p>

<p>football (p. 13);</p>

<p>bear-baiting (p. 13).</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that the spelling of the name in the
Pepysian copy is specially divided thus&mdash;Hic-ka-thrift;
and though it seems probable that some good reason must be
assigned to this, I cannot find out points of importance. But
about the dubbing him Mr. (p. 7) or Master, as it would
be in full, there is something of great interest to point out.
This was formerly a distinct title. In Harrison&#8217;s <i>Description
of England</i> we read, &#8220;Who soeuer studieth the lawes of the
realme, who so abideth in the vniuersitie, or prefesseth physicke
and the liberall sciences, or beside his seruice in the roome of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
a capteine in the warres can liue without manuell labour, and
thereto is able and will beare the post, charge, and countenance
of a gentleman, he shall be called master, which is the
title that men giue to esquiers and gentlemen and reputed for
gentlemen.&#8221;&mdash;Harrison&#8217;s <i>Description of England</i>, 1577 (edited
by F. J. Furnivall for the New Shakspere Society, 1877),
p. 129.</p>

<p>Of yeomen he says, &#8220;And albeit they be not called master
as gentlemen are, or sir as to knights apperteineth, but onelie
John and Thomas,&#8221; &amp;c. (p. 134): and of &#8220;the third and
last sort,&#8221; &#8220;named the yeomanrie,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;that they be
not called masters and gentlemen, but goodmen, as goodman
Smith, goodman Coot, goodman Cornell, goodman Mascall,
goodman Cockswet,&#8221; &amp;c. (p. 137).</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall&#8217;s note (p. 123) is as follows:&mdash;&#8220;<i>Every
Begger almost is called Maister.</i>&mdash;See Lancelot&#8217;s &#8216;<span class="smcap">Maister</span>
Launcelet&#8217; in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, II. ii. 51, and the
extract illustrating it from Sir Thomas Smith&#8217;s <i>Commonwealth
of England</i>, bk. I. ch. 20 (founded on Harrison, i. 133, 137),
which I printed in <i>New Sh. Soc.&#8217;s Trans.</i> 1877-9, p. 103-4.
Also Shakspere getting his &#8216;yeoman&#8217; father arms, and making
him a &#8216;gentleman&#8217; in 1596.&mdash;(Leopold Shakspere, Introduction,
p. ciii.).&#8221; We thus get still further indication of the early
date of the story, the significance of the title &#8220;Master&#8221; having
died out during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the reign before William the conqueror, I have read in
ancient histories that there dwelt a man in the marsh of the
Isle of Ely, in the county of Cambridge, whose name was
Thomas Hic-ka-thrift, a poor man and day labourer, yet he
was a very stout man, and able to perform two days works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
instead of one: He having one son and no more children in
the world, he called him by his own name, Thomas Hickathrift.
This old man put his son to good learning, but he would take
none, for he was as we call them now in this age, none of the
wisest sort, but something soft, and had no docility at all in
him.</p>

<p>God calling this old man his father out of the world, his
mother being tender of him, and maintained him by her hand
labour as well as she could; he being sloathful and not willing
to work to get a penny for his living, but all his delight was to
be in the chimney corner, and would eat as much at one time
as might very well serve four or five ordinary men; for he was
in length when he was but ten years of age about eight foot,
and in thickness five foot, and his hand was like unto a shoulder
of mutton, and in all parts from top to toe he was like a monster,
and yet his great strength was not known.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>How Tom Hic-ka-thrifts strength came to be known, the which
if you please but to read will give you full satisfaction.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The first time that his strength was known was by his
mothers going to a rich farmer&#8217;s house (she being but a poor
woman) to desire a buttle of straw to shift herself and her son
Thomas. The farmer being an honest charitable man, bid her
take what she would. She going home to her son Tom, said,
I pray thee go to such a place and fetch me a buttle of straw, I
have asked him leave. He swore a great oath he would not go:
nay, prithee, Tom go, said his old mother. He swore again
he would not go, unless she would borrow him a cart rope.
She being willing to please him, because she would have some
straw, went and borrowed him a cart rope to his desire.</p>

<p>He taking it went his way; so coming to the farmer&#8217;s house,
the master was in the barn, and two men a thrashing. Said
Tom, I am come for a buttle of straw. Tom, said the master,
take as much as thou canst carry. He laid down his cart rope,
and began to make his buttle; but said they, Tom, thy rope is
to short, and jeer&#8217;d poor Tom, but he fitted the man well for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it: for he made his buttle, and when he had made it, there was
supposed to be a load of straw in it, of two thousand weight.
But said they, what a great fool art thou, thou canst not carry
the tith on&#8217;t? but Tom took the buttle and flung it on his
shoulder, and made no more of it then we do of an hundred
weight, to the great admiration of master and men.</p>

<p>Tom Hic-ka-thrift&#8217;s strength being known in the town, then
they would not let him any longer lie basking by the fire in the
chimney corner, every one would be hiring him to work; they
seeing him to have so much strength, told him that it was a
shame for him to live such a lazy course of life, and to lie idle
day after day, as he did. So Tom seeing them bait at him in
such a manner as they did, he went first to one work then to
another; but at length came a man to Tom and desired him
to go with him unto the wood, for he had a tree to bring home,
and he would content him. So Tom went with him, and he
took with him four men beside; but when they came to the
wood, they set the cart by the tree and began to draw it up
with pullies; but Tom seeing them not able to lift it up, said,
stand away, you fools, and takes the tree and sets it on one end,
and lays it in the cart. Now, says he, see what a man can do.
Marry, it is true, said they. So when they had done coming
through the wood they met the woodman, Tom asked him for
a stick to make his mother a fire with. I, said the wood-man,
take one what thou canst carry. So Tom espyed a tree bigger
then was in the cart, and lays it on his shoulder, and goes home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with it as fast as the cart and six horses could draw it. This
was the second time that Tom&#8217;s strength was known.</p>

<p>So when Tom began to know that he had more strength
then twenty men had, he then began to be merry with men
and very tractable, and would run, or go, or jump, and took
great delight to be amongst company, and to go to fairs and
meetings, and to see sports and pastimes. So going to a feast,
the young men were all met, some to cudgels, some to wrastling,
some throwing the hammer, and the like; so Tom stood a
little to see their sport, and at last goes to them that were a
throwing the hammer; and standing a little by to behold their
manlike sport, at last he takes the hammer in his hand to feel
the weight of it, and bid them stand out of the way, for he
would throw it as far as he could. I, said the smith, and jeer&#8217;d
poor Tom, you&#8217;l threw it a great way I&#8217;le warrant you; but
Tom took the hammer and flung it; and there was a river
about five or six furlungs off, and flung it into that; so when
he had done, he bid the smith go fetch his hammer again, and
laught the smith to scorn; but when Tom had done that, he
would go to wrastling, though he had no more skill than an
ass had, but what he did by strength; yet he flung all that
came, for if once he laid hold they were gone. Some he would
throw over his head, some he would lay down slyly, and how
he pleased; he would not lock nor strike at their heels, but
flung them two or three yards from him, ready to break their
necks asunder; so that none at last durst go into the ring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wrastle with him, for they took him to be some devil that was
come amongst them; so Tom&#8217;s fame was spread more in the
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>How Tom came to be a Brewer&#8217;s man; and how he came to
kill a Giant, and at last was Mr. Hic-ka-thrift.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tom&#8217;s fame being spread abroad in the country, there was
not a man durst give Tom an angry word for he was something
foolhardy, and he did not care what he did at them;
so that those that knew him would not in the least displease
him. But at length there was a brewer at Lyn, that wanted
a good lusty man to carry his beer in the marsh and to Wisbech;
so hearing of Tom went to hire him, but Tom seemed
coy and would not be his man, until his mother and friends did
perswade him, and his master intreated him; and likewise promised
him a new suit of clothes and cloath him from top to
toe; and besides he should eat and drink of the best. So Tom
at last yielded to be his man, and his master told him how far he
should go; for you are to understand there was a monstrous
Gyant, who kept some part of the marsh, and none durst go
that way; for if they did he would keep them or kill them, or
else he would make bond slaves of them.</p>

<p>But to come to Tom and his master, that he did more work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in one day then all his men would do in three; so that his
master, seeing him so tractable, and to look so well after his
business, made him his head man to go into the marsh, to carry
beer by himself, for he needed no man with him. So Tom
went every day to Wisbich, which was a very great journey,
for it was twenty mile the road way.</p>

<p>Tom going so long that wearisome journey, and finding that
way which the Gyant kept was nearer by half, and Tom having
gotten more strength by half then before by being so well kept,
and drinking so much strong ale as he did; one day he was
going to Wisbich, and without saying anything to his master or
to any of his fellow servants, he was resolved to make the
nearest way to be a road or lose his life, to win the horse, or
lose the saddle; to kill or be killed; if he met with the Gyant;
and with this resolution he goes the nearest way with his cart,
flinging open the gates for his cart and horses to go through;
but at last the Gyant spying him, and seeing him to be so bold,
thought to prevent him, and came intending to take his beer for
a prize, but Tom cared not a fart for him, and the Gyant he
met Tom like a lyon, as though he would have swallowed him.
Sirrah, said he, who gave you authority to come this way? Do
you not know that I make all stand in fear of my sight, and you
like a rogue must come and fling my gates open at your pleasure!
How dare you presume to do this? Are you so careless
of your life? Do you not care what you do? I&#8217;le make thee
an example for all rogues under the sun; dost thou not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
how many heads hang upon yonder tree that have offended
my law! But thy head shall hang higher then all the rest
for an example. But Tom made him answer, A turd in your
teeth for your news, for you shall not find me like one of them.
No, said the Gyant, why thou art but a fool, dost thou come
to fight with such a one as I am, and bring no weapon to
defend thyself withal? Said Tom, I have a weapon here will
make you to know you are a traytorly rogue. I, sirrah, said
the Gyant, and took that word in high disdain, that Tom
should call him a traytorly rogue, and with that he ran into his
cave to fetch his great club, intending to dash out Tom&#8217;s brains
at the first blow.</p>

<p>Tom knew not what to do for a weapon, for he knew his
whip would do but little good against such a monstrous beast as
he was, for he was in length twelve foot, and six foot about the
waste; but while the Gyant went for his club, Tom bethought
himself of a very good weapon, for he makes no more ado, but
takes his cart and turns it upside down, and takes the axletree
and the wheel for his shield and buckler, and very good weapons
they were in such time of need.</p>

<p>The Giant coming out again, began to stare at Tom, to see
him take the wheel in one hand and the axle tree in the other
to defend himself with. O! said the Gyant, you are like to do
great service with those weapons; I have here a twig, said the
Gyant, that will beat thee and thy wheel and axle tree at once unto
the ground; that which the Gyant called a twig was as thick as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
some mill posts are, but Tom was not daunted for all that, for
he saw there was but one way to kill or be killed; so the Giant
made at Tom with such a vehement force that he made Tom&#8217;s
wheel crack again, and Tom lent the Gyant another as good,
for he took him such a weighty blow on the side of the head
that he made the Gyant reel again. What, said Tom, are you
drunk with my strong beer already.</p>

<p>The Gyant recovering laid on Tom most sad blows; but
still as they came Tom kept them off with his wheel so that he
had no hurt at all. Tom plyed his work so well, and laid such
huge blows at the Giant, that the sweat and blood together
ran down his face, and he being fat and foggy, and fighting so
long, was almost tired out, asked Tom to let him drink a little,
and then he would fight with him again. No, said Tom, my
mother did not teach me that wit; who&#8217;s a fool then? Tom
seeing the Gyant begin to be weary, and finding him to fail in
his blows, he thought best to make hay while the sun did shine,
for he laid on so fast as though he had been mad, till he had
brought the Gyant to the ground. The Gyant seeing himself
down, and Tom laying so hard on him, roared in a most sad
condition, and prayed him not to take away his life and he
would do anything for him, and yield himself to him and be
his servant; but Tom having no more mercy on him than a
dog of a bear, laid still at the Gyant &#8217;till he had laid him for
dead, and when he had done he cut off his head and went
into his cave, and there he found great store of silver and gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which made his heart to leap. But when he had done, he
loaded his cart and went to Wisbich and delivered his beer;
and coming home to his master, he told it to him; but his
master was so overjoy&#8217;d at the news that he would not believe
him till he had seen; and getting up the next day he and his
master went to see if he spoke true or no, and most of the town
of Lyn. But when they came to the place and found the
Gyant dead, he shewed them where the head was, and what
silver and gold there was in the cave, all of them leapt for joy,
for the Gyant was a great enemy to all the country.</p>

<p>This news was spread all up and down the country how
Tom Hic-ka-thrift had kill&#8217;d the Gyant, and well was he that
could run or go to see the Gyant and the cave; then all the
folks made bonefires for joy; and Tom was a better man
respected than before. And Tom took possession of the cave
by consent of the country, and everyone said that he did
deserve twice as much more. So Tom pulled down the cave
and built him a brave house where the cave stood; all the
ground that the Gyant kept by force and strength, some he
gave to the poor for their common, and the rest he made pastures
of and divided the most part into good ground to maintain
him and his old mother Jane Hic-ka-thrift. And Tom&#8217;s fame
was spread both far and near throughout the country; and then
it was no longer Tom, but Mr. Hickathrift, so that he was
now the chiefest man amongst them, for the people feared Tom&#8217;s
anger as much as they did the Gyant before. So Tom kept men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and maids, and lived most bravely; and he made him a park to
keep deer in; and by his house, which is a town, he built a
famous church and gave it the name of St. James&#8217; Church,
because he killed the Gyant on that day, which is so to this
hour and ever will be; and many more good deeds he did which
is too tedious to write in this column, but to tell the chief I
shall do my endeavour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>How Tom kept a pack of Hounds; and kickt a Foot-ball quite
away; and how he had like to have been robbed by Four Thieves,
and how he escaped.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tom having so much about him and not used to it could
hardly tell how for to dispose of it, but yet he did use a means
to do it, for he kept a pack of hounds, and men to hunt with
him; and who but Tom then. So he took such delight in
sport that he would go far and near to any meetings, as cudgel-play,
bear-baiting, football play, and the like. But as Tom was
riding one day, he seeing a company at football play he lighted
off his horse to see that rare sport, for they were playing for a
wager; but Tom was a stranger there and none did know him
there; but Tom soon spoiled their sport, for he meeting the
football took it such a kick that they never found their ball no
more; they could see it fly, but whither none could tell, nor to
what place; they all wondered at it, and began to quarrel with
Tom, but some of them got nothing by it, for Tom gets a spar
which belonged to a house that was blown down and all that
stood in his way he either killed or knocked down, so that all
the country was up in arms to take Tom, but all in vain, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
manfully made way wherever he came. So when he was gone
from them, and was going homeward, he chanced to be somewhat
late in the evening. On the road there met him four lusty
rogues that had been robbing of passengers that way, and none
could escape them, for they robbed all they met, both rich and
poor. They thought when they met Tom they should get a
good prize, they perceiving he was alone, made them cocksure
of his money, but they were mistaken, for he got a prize by
them. When they met with Tom they straight bid him stand
and deliver. What, said Tom, what should I deliver? Your
money, sirrah, said they. But, said Tom, you shall give me
better words for it first, and be better armed too. Come, come,
said they, we do not come hither to prate, but we come for
money, and money we will have before you stir from this place.
I, said Tom, is it so? Nay then, said he, get it, and take it.</p>

<p>So one of them made at him, but he presently unarmed him,
and took away his sword which was made of good trusty steel,
and smote so hard at the others that they began to set spurs
to their horses and begone, but he soon stayed their journey,
one of them having a portmantle behind him, Tom perceiving
it to be money fought with more courage then he did before,
till at the last he had killed two of the four, and the other
two he wounded most grievously that they cryed for quarter.
So with much intreating he gave them quarter, but he took
all their money which was two hundred pounds to bear his
charges home. So when Tom came home he told them how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he had served the football players and the four thieves which
caused a laugh from his old mother, and to refresh himself went
to see how all things did, and what his men had done since he
went from home. And going to the forest he wandred up
and down, and at last met with a lusty tinker that had a good
staff on his shoulder and a great dog to carry his bag and tools.
So Tom asked the tinker from whence he came, and whither
he was going, for that was no highway. But the tinker being
a sturdy fellow bid him go look, and what was that to him,
but fools must be meddling. No, says Tom, but I&#8217;le make you
to know before you and I part it is to me. I, said the tinker,
I have been these three long years and have not had one
combat with any man. I have challenged many a man but
none durst make me answer; I think, said he, they be all
cowards in this country, but I hear there is a man in this
country which is called Tom Hickathrift that killed a gyant;
him I would fain see, said the tinker, to have one combat with
him. I, said Tom, but methinks, said he, it might be master
with you; I am the man, said he, what have you to say to me?
Why verily, said the tinker, I am glad we are so happily met
together, that we may have one single combat. Sure, said
Tom, you do but jest. Marry, said the tinker, I am in earnest.
A match, said Tom. &#8217;Tis done, said the tinker. But, said
Tom, will you give me leave to get me a twig? I, said the
tinker, hang him that will fight with a man unarmed, I scorn
that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>So Tom steps to the gate and takes one of the rails for his staff;
so to it they fell, the Tinker at Tom, and Tom at the Tinker,
like two giants they laid on at each other. The Tinker had a
leathern coat on, and at every blow Tom gave the Tinker,
his coat roar&#8217;d again, yet the Tinker did not give way to Tom
an inch. But Tom gave the Tinker a blow on the side of the
head, which felled the Tinker. Now, Tinker, where are you?
said Tom.</p>

<p>But the Tinker being a nimble fellow, leapt up again, and
gave Tom a blow, made him reel again, and followed his blows,
and took Tom on the other side which made Tom&#8217;s neck
crack again. So Tom flung down his weapon and yielded
the Tinker the better on&#8217;t, and took him home to his house,
where I shall leave Tom and the Tinker till they be recovered
of their sad wounds and bruises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom Hickathrift and the Tinker conquered and overcame three
thousand rebellious subjects.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> and about the Isle of Ely, many disaffected persons, to the
number of ten thousand and upwards drew themselves up in a
body, presuming to contend for their pretended ancient Rights
and Liberties, insomuch that the Gentry and civil Magistrates
of the Country was in great danger; at which time the Sheriff,
by night, privately got into the house of Thomas Hickathrift,
as a secure place of refuge, in so eminent a time of danger: where
before Thomas Hickathrift, he laid open the villainous intent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
this headstrong giddy-brained multitude, Mr. Sheriff, quoth Tom,
what service my brother, meaning the Tinker, and I can perform,
shall not be wanting. This said, in the morning by day-break,
with trusty clubs they both went forth, desiring the Sheriff to be
their guide, in conducting them to the place of the rebels&#8217; rendezvous,
when they came there Tom and the Tinker marched
up to the head of the multitude, and demanded of them the
reason why they disturbed the Government? To which they
answered with a loud cry, Our will&#8217;s our law; and by that
alone will we be governed. Nay quoth Tom if it be so, these
trusty clubs are our weapons, and by them you shall be chastised.
Which words were no sooner out of his mouth but the
Tinker and he put themselves both together in the midst of the
throng and with their clubs beat the multitude down, trampling
them under their feet every blow which they struck laid
twenty or thirty sprawling before them. Nay, remarkable it
was, the Tinker struck a tall man just upon the nape of the
neck, with that force that his head flew off, and was carried violently
fourteen foot from him, where it knockt down one of
their chief ringleaders; Tom on the other hand still pressing
forward, till by an unfortunate blow he broke his club; yet he
was not in the least dismay&#8217;d; for he presently seized upon a
lusty stout rawbon&#8217;d miller, and made use of him for a weapon,
till at length they clear&#8217;d the field; so that there was not one
found that dare lift up a hand against them, having run into
holes and corners to hide themselves shortly after some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their heads were taken and made public examples of justice, the
rest being pardoned at the humble request of Thomas Hickathrift
and the Tinker.</p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom Hickathrift and the Tinker was sent for to Court and of
their kind entertainment there, etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The King being truly informed of the faithful services perform&#8217;d
by these his loving Subjects, Thomas Hickathrift and
the Tinker, he was pleased to send for them to his Palace, where
a Royal banquet was prepared for their entertainment, most of
the Nobility being present. Now after the banquet was over,
the King said unto all that were there, these are my trusty and
well-beloved subjects, men of approved courage and valour, they
are the men that overcame and conquer&#8217;d ten thousand which
were got together to disturb the peace of my realm; according
to the character that hath been given to Tho. Hickathrift and
Henry Nonesuch, persons here present, they cannot be matcht in
any other kingdom in the world; were it possible to have an
army of twenty thousand such as these, I dare venture to act
the part of Alexander the Great over again: yet in the meanwhile,
as a proof of my Royal favour, kneel down and receive
the antient order of knighthood, Mr. Hickathrift, which was
instantly perform&#8217;d. And as for Henry Nonesuch, I will settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
upon him, as a reward for his great service, the sum of Forty
Shillings a year, during life. Which said, the King withdrew,
and Sir Thomas Hickathrift and Henry Nonesuch the tinker,
returned home, attended by many persons of quality, some miles
from the Court. But to the great grief of Sir Thomas, at his
return from the Court, he found his aged Mother drawing to
her end, who in a few days after died and was buried in the Isle
of Ely.</p>

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom after his old Mother&#8217;s death went a wooing; and how he
served a young Gallant who affronted him before his Mistress.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tom&#8217;s mother being dead, and he left alone in a large and
spacious house, he found himself strange and uncouth, therefore
he began to consider with himself that it would not be amiss to
seek out for a wife; and hearing of a young rich widow, not
far from Cambridge, to her he went, and made his addresses: and
at the first coming she seem&#8217;d to shew him much favour and
countenance; but between this and his coming again, she had
given some entertainment to a more genteel and airy spark,
who happened likewise to come while honest Tom was there
the second time; he look&#8217;d wishfully at Tom, and he star&#8217;d
as wishfully at him again; at last the young spark began with
abuseful language to affront Tom, telling him he was such a
great lubberly whelp, adding that such a one as he should not
pretend to make love to a Lady, as he was but a Brewer&#8217;s servant.
Scoundrel quoth Tom better words should become you, and if
you do not mend your manners, you shall not fail to feel my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sharp correction. At which the young Spark challenged him
forth into the back yard; for, as he said, he did not question
but to make a fool of Tom in a trice. Into the yard they both
walk together, the young spark with a naked sword, and Tom
with neither stick nor staff in his hand, nor any other weapon.
What says the spark, have you nothing to defend yourself?
well I shall the sooner dispatch you. Which said, he ran
furiously forward, making a pass at Tom, which he put by,
and then wheeling round to his backside, Tom gave him such
a swinging kick on the breech, which sent the spark like a
Crow up into the Air, from whence he fell upon the ridge of a
thatcht house, and then came down into a large fish pond, and
had been certainly drown&#8217;d if it had not been for a poor
shepherd who was walking that way, and seeing him float
upon the water, dragged him out with his hook, and home he
returned like a drowned Rat; while Tom enjoy&#8217;d the kind
embraces of his fair Mistress.</p>

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom served two Troopers, whom the young Spark had hired to
beset him, etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This young galland being tormented in his mind to think
how Tom had conquered and sham&#8217;d him before his Mistress,
he was now resolved for speedy revenge; and knowing that he
was not able to coap with a man of Tom&#8217;s strength and
activity, he therefore hired two lusty Troopers, well mounted, to
lie in ambush in a thicket which Tom had to pass through from
his home to the young lady, and accordingly they attempted to
set upon him: How now quoth Tom Rascals, what would
you be at? Are you indeed weary of the world, that you so
unadvisably set upon one who is able to crush you in like a Cucumber;
the Troopers laughing at him, said, that they were not
to be daunted at his high words, High words quoth Tom, no
I will come to action; and with that he run in between these
armed Troopers, catching them under his arm. Horse and Men,
with as much ease as if they had been but a couple of Baker&#8217;s
babbins, steering his course with them hastily towards his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
home, and, as he pass&#8217;d thro&#8217; a meadow, in which there was
many Haymakers at work, the poor distressed troopers crying
out, Stop him stop him he runs away with two of the King&#8217;s
troopers. The hay-makers laught heartily to see how Tom
hugged them along; ever and anon he upbraided them for their
baseness; declared that he would make minced meat of them
to feed the Crows and Jackdaws about his house and habitation.
This was such a dreadful lecture to them, that the poor rogues
begg&#8217;d that he would be merciful, and spare their lives, and they
would discover the whole plot, and who was the person that
employ&#8217;d them; which accordingly they did, and gain&#8217;d favour
in the sight of Tom, who pardon&#8217;d them upon promise that
they would never be concern&#8217;d in such a villainous action for
the time to come.</p>

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom going to be married, was set upon by one-and-twenty
Ruffians in Armour, and of the havock he made amongst them, etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In regard Tom had been hinder&#8217;d by these troopers, he
delay&#8217;d his visit to his Lady till next day, and then coming to
her, gave her a full account of what had happen&#8217;d; she was
pleased at heart at this wonderful relation, knowing it was safe
for a woman to marry with a man who was able to defend her
against all assaults whatsoever, and such a one she found Tom
to be. The day of marriage was accordingly appointed, friends
and relations invited. Yet secret malice which is never satisfied
without sweet revenge, had like to have prevented the
solemnity for having three miles to go to church, where they
were to be married, the aforesaid Gentleman had provided a
second time Ruffians in armour to the number of twenty-one,
he himself being then present either to destroy the life of
Tom, or put them into strange consternation; however thus it
happened, in a lonesome place they bolted out upon them,
making their first assault upon Tom, and with a Speer gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
him a slight wound, at which his love and the rest of the
women shrieked and cry&#8217;d like persons out of their wits, Tom
endeavour&#8217;d all that he could to pacify them, saying, stand you
still and I will show you pleasant sport. And with that he
catch&#8217;d a back sword from the side of a Gentleman in his own
company, with which he so bravely behaved himself that at
every stroke he cut off a joint, loth he was to touch the life
of any, but aiming at their legs and arms, he lopt them off so
fast, that in less than a quarter of an hour, there was not one
in the company but what had lost a limb, the green grass being
stained with their purple gore, and the ground strew&#8217;d with legs
and arms, as &#8217;tis with tiles from the tops of the Houses after a
dreadful storm. His Love and the rest of the company standing
all the while as joyful spectators, laughing one at another,
saying, What a company of cripples has he made, as it were
in the twinkling of an eye! Yes, quoth Tom, I believe that
for every drop of blood that I lost, I have made the Rascals pay
me a limb as a just tribute. This done, he stept to a Farmer&#8217;s
hard by, and hired there a servant giving him twenty shillings
to carry these cripples home to their respective habitations in
his dung-cart; and then did he hasten with his love to the
church, where they were married, and then returned home,
where they were heartily merry with their friends, after their
fierce and dreadful encounter.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Tom made a feast for all the poor Widows in the adjacent towns;
and how he served an old Woman who stole a Silver Cup at the
same time, etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now Tom being married, he made a plentiful feast, to which
he invited all the poor widows in four or five parishes for the
sake of his mother, which he had lately buried, this feast
was kept in his own house, with all manner of varieties that the
country could afford for the space of four days, in honour likewise
of the four victories which he lately obtain&#8217;d. Now when the
time of feasting was ended, a Silver Cup was missing, and being
ask&#8217;d about it, they every one deny&#8217;d they knew any thing of it. At
length it was agreed that they should all stand the search, which
they did, and the Cup was found upon a certain old woman,
named the Widow Stumbelow; then was all the rest in a rage,
some was for hanging her, others were for chopping the old
woman in pieces, for her ingratitude to such a generous soul as
Sir Thomas Hickathrift; but he entreated them all to be
quiet, saying they should not murder a poor old Woman, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would appoint a punishment for her himself; which was this;
he bor&#8217;d a hole thro&#8217; her nose and tying a string therein, then
order&#8217;d her to be stript stark naked, commanding the rest of
the old women to stick a candle in her fundament, and lead
her by the nose thro&#8217; all the streets and lanes in Cambridge,
which comical sight caused a general laughter. This done, she
had her cloaths restor&#8217;d her again, and so was acquitted.</p>

<p><i>Sir Thomas Hickathrift and his Lady was sent for to Court,
and of what happened.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The tydings of Tom&#8217;s wedding was soon nois&#8217;d in the
Court, so that the King sent them a royal invitation to the end
he might see his Lady, they immediately went, and were received
with all demonstrations of Joy and Triumph. But while
they were in their mirth, a dreadful cry approached the Court
which proved to be the Commons of Kent who were come
thither to complain of a dreadful Giant that was landed in one
of the Islands: And brought with him abundance of Bears and
young Lyons, likewise a dreadful Dragon on which he himself
rid, which monster and ravenous beasts had frighted all the
inhabitants out of the Island. Moreover they said if speedy
course was not taken to suppress them in time, they might
over-run the whole land. The King hearing this dreadful
relation was a little startled, yet he perswaded them to return
home and make the best defence they could for themselves at
present, assuring them that he should not forget them, and so
they departed.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Thomas Hickathrift was made Governor of the Island of the
East Angles, now called Thanet, and of the wonderful Achievements
he performed there.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The King hearing the aforesaid dreadful Tydings, immediately
sate in Council to consider what was to be done for the overcoming
this monstrous Giant, and barbarous savage Lyons and
Bears that with him had invaded his Princely territories. At
length it was agreed upon that Thomas Hickathrift was the
most likeliest man in the whole kingdom, for undertaking of so
dangerous an enterprise; he being not only a fortunate man of
great strength, but likewise a true and trusty subject one that
was always ready and willing to do his King and country
service, for which reason it was thought necessary to make him
Governor of the aforesaid Island; which place of trust and
honour, he readily received, and accordingly he forthwith went
down with his wife and family, to take possession of the same,
attended with a hundred Knights and Gentlemen, who conducted
him to the entrance of the Island which he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
govern. A castle in those days there was, in which he was to
take up his head-quarters, the same being situated with that
advantage that he could view the Island for several miles upon
occasion; the Knights and Gentlemen at last taking their leave
of him, wish&#8217;d him all happy success and prosperity. Many
days he had not been there before it was his fortune to behold
the monstrous Giant mounted upon a dreadful Dragon, bearing
upon his shoulder a club of Iron, having but one eye, the which
was placed in his forehead, and larger in compass than a barber&#8217;s
bason, and seem&#8217;d to appear like a flaming fire; his visage was
dreadful, grim and tawny; the hair of his head hanging down
his back and shoulders, like snakes of a prodigious length; the
bristles of his Beard like rusty wire: And lifting up his blare
eye, he happened to discover Sir Thomas Hickathrift, who
was looking upon him from one of his windows of the castle;
the Giant then began to knit his brow, and breath forth
threatening words to the Governor, who indeed was a little
surpriz&#8217;d at the approach of so monstrous a brute; the Giant
finding that Tom did not make much haste down to meet him,
he alighted from the back of the dragon, and chained the same
to an Oak tree, then marching furiously to the castle, setting his
broad shoulder against a corner of the stone walls, as if he
intended to overthrow the whole building at once which Tom
perceiving, said is this the game you would be at; faith I shall
spoil your sport, for I have a delicate tool to pick your teeth
withal; then taking his two handed sword of five foot long, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
weapon which the King had given him to govern with taking
this I say, down he went, and flinging open the Gates, he there
found the Giant, who by an unfortunate slip in his thrusting
was fallen all along, where he lay and could not help himself.
What, quoth Tom, do you come here to take up your Lodging?
This is not to be suffer&#8217;d, and with that he ran his long broad
sword in betwixt the monstrous Giant&#8217;s brawny Buttocks and
out at his Belly, which made the monstrous Brute give such a
terrible groan that it seemed like roaring thunder, making the
very neighbouring trees to tremble; and then Tom pulling out
his sword again, at six or seven blows he separated his head
from his unconscionable trunk, which head, when it was off,
seemed like the root of a mighty Oak. Then turning to the
Dragon, which was all this while chain&#8217;d to a tree, without any
farther discourse, with four blows with his two-handed sword,
he cut off his head also. This fortunate adventure being over,
he sent immediately for a team of horses and a waggon: which
he loaded with these heads, and then summoning all the
Constables in the Country for a guard, sent them to Court,
with a promise to his Majesty, that he would rid the whole
Island likewise of Bears and Lyons before he left it.</p>

<h3>CHAP. IX.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The Tinker hearing of Tom s Fame went down to be Partner
in his Enterprize; and how he was unfortunately slain by a Lyon.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Tom&#8217;s victories rang so long, that they reach&#8217;d the ears of
his old acquaintance, the Tinker, who, desirous of honour,
resolved to go down and visit Tom in his new government,
when coming there he met with kind and loving entertainment,
for they were very joyful to see one another: Now after three
or four days&#8217; enjoyment of one another&#8217;s company, Tom told the
Tinker that he must needs go forth in search after wild Bears
and Lyons, in order to rout them out of the Island. Well,
quoth the Tinker, I would gladly take my fortune with you,
hoping that I may be serviceable to you, upon occasion. Well,
quoth Tom, with all my heart, for I must needs acknowledge
I shall be right glad of your company. This said, they both
went forward, Tom with his two handed sword, and the Tinker
with his long pike-staff. Now after they had travelled about
four or five hours, it was their fortune to light of the whole
knot of wild beasts together, being in number fourteen, of
which six of them were Bears, the other eight young Lyons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
now when they had fastened their eyes upon Tom and the
Tinker, these ravenous beasts began to roar and run furiously,
as if they would have devoured them at a mouthful; but Tom
and the Tinker stood side by side with their backs against an
Oak, and as the Lyons and Bears came within their reach, Tom
with his long sword clove their heads asunder till they were all
destroyed, saving one lyon, who, seeing the rest of his Fellows
slain, was endeavouring to make his escape: now the Tinker
being somewhat too venturous, ran too hastily after him, and
having given the Lyon one blow, he turn&#8217;d upon him again,
seizing him by the throat with that violence, that the poor
Tinker fell dead to the Ground; Tom Hickathrift, seeing this,
gave the Lyon such a blow that it ended his life.</p>

<p>Now was his joy mingled with sorrow for tho&#8217; he had
cleared the Island of those ravenous savage beasts, yet his grief
was intolerable for the loss of his old friend. Home he returned
to his lady, where in token of Joy for the wonderful success
which he had in his dangerous enterprizes, he made a very noble
and splendid Feast, to which he invited most of his best Friends
and Acquaintance, to whom he made the following Promise.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
